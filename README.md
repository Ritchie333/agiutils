This repo consists of various utilities working with Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) system. These include:

* agic - logic compiler
* showlog - logic decompiler
* volx2 - version 2 logic extracter
* xv3 - version 3 logic extracter

The utilities were all written for MS-DOS, but have been recompiled to work under Unix with recent compilers, with some bug fixes.

The copyrights for the invidual utilities are listed in their respective subdirectories.
