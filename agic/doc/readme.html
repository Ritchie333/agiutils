<hr>
<p>You now have Floating Hills Software's AGIC (AGI compiler) and the associated utilities, including a port of the GNU C preprocessor and a simple-minded program to recombine extracted AGI resources into a new volume-file.  They are released as free software with the intention that they might be useful to someone.  Read COPYING for details.</p>
<p>To contact the people who wrote the software, you can write to greekcat@hotmail.com.  If you use any of the AGIC code in another program, we would also like to hear about that.</p>
<p>This version of AGIC compiles the Template Game!  Time to create real AGI games!</p>
