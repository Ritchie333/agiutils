<h2>What is AGIGLUE?</h2>
<p>AGIGLUE takes a directory full of files containing the resources of an AGI game and glues them back into one monolithic VOL.0 file.</p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>Extract all the resources of an AGI game into individual files (with the filename the name of the resource and the extension the resource number).  Then run AGIGLUE in that directory.  AGIGLUE will attempt to open all the files in that directory and glue them all into one big VOL.0 file and the associated directory files.  If it is successful, then those files can be used in place of the normal files for an AGI intrepreter.</p>
<h2>But how do I extract all the resources?</h2>
<p>There are a number of utilities available now to do this, most notably, AGI Studio.</p>
