You now have Floating Hills Software's AGIC (AGI compiler) and the 
associated utilities, including a port of the GNU C preprocessor and a 
simple-minded program to recombine extracted AGI resources into a new 
volume-file. They are released as free software with the intention 
that they might be useful to someone. Read COPYING for details. 

To contact the people who wrote the software, you can write to 
greekcat@hotmail.com. If you use any of the AGIC code in another 
program, we would also like to hear about that. 

This version of AGIC compiles the Template Game! Time to create real 
AGI games!
